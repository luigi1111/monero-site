### How this Project is Funded

Ongoing development of the Monero Project is solely supported by donations and sponsors. At this time the project is vastly underfunded, and thus donations are greatly appreciated.

### Donating and Sponsoring

If you would like to make a donation you can do so by using any of the methods below:

- Donating in Monero: you can send XMR donations to [donate.getmonero.org](monero:46BeWrHpwXmHDpDEUmZBWZfoQpdc6HaERCNmx1pEYL2rAcuwufPN9rXHHtyUA4QVy66qeFQkn6sfK8aHYjA3jk3o1Bv16em?recipient_name=Monero%20Development&tx_description=Donation%20to%20Monero%20Core%20Team), or directly to our Monero donation address -
